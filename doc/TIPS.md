## General Tips

- See the [tutorial](TUTORIAL.md) for information on the `pafi-path-test` routine

- In general, we want a reference pathway with dense discretisation where energy gradients are large

- The current non-smoothed spline implementation can oscillate between very similar image configurations, as a result, there should be non-negligible displacement between images

- If your path isn't loading, try setting `LogLammps=1` in `config.xml` to check for bugs in `log.lammps`

## Notes on choosing parameters

- If `SampleSteps` is too large workers will make thermally activated "jumps" to nearby paths in the hyperplane. This will return a warning message `Reference path too unstable for sampling.`
 and increase error. If this happens, decrease `SampleSteps` and increase `nRepeats`

- When running on `NPROCS` cores, we require `NPROCS%CoresPerWorker==0`, so we have an integer number of workers

- The total number of force calls *per worker* is `nPlanes * (ThermSteps+SampleSteps) * nRepeats`, spatially parallelised by LAMMPS across `CoresPerWorker` cores for each worker.

- Each PAFI worker runs at the same speed as LAMMPS. Increasing `CoresPerWorker` will typically decrease execution time but also reduce `nWorkers` and increase error, as we have less samples.

- If you are core-limited, the `nRepeats` option forces workers to perform multiple independent sampling runs on each plane. For example, with all other parameters fixed, running on 32 cores with `nRepeats=3` is equivalent to running on 3*32=96 cores with  `nRepeats=1`, but the latter will finish in a third of the time.
